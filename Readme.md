# Real Estate Price Prediction using Simple Linear Regression

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict house prices based on square footage using simple linear regression. Real estate analytics is a booming field, and even simple models can provide valuable insights. By modeling the relationship between square footage and house price, we can make predictions that help buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from GitHub and contains the following columns:
- `beds`: Number of bedrooms
- `baths`: Number of bathrooms
- `size`: Square footage of the house
- `zip_code`: ZIP code of the house location
- `price`: Price of the house
